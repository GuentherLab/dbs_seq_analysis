###Description of this script
##  This script allows for scoring of duration on trials for the DBS-SEQ experiment. The script will create 
##  and open a TextGrid accompanying each sound file in a directory. 
##  
##  This script does not contain accuracy or stop-response-type tiers, and is useful for when you are only scoring speech epoch. 

## Tier 1: SpeechEpoch - indicate speech onset, vowel offset, and (if present) coda consonant offset
##	-if the offset is released, mark 4 timepoints: speech onset, voicing onset, voicing offset, and final-consonant offset
##	-if the offset is not released, mark 3 timepoints: speech onset, voicing onset, and voicing/syllable offset
##	...	
##	... click the 'SpeechEpoch' tier (it should turn yellow)
##	... select the onset or offset individually and press Enter
##  Tier 2: Comments - use this Tier to add comments about the trial, e.g. if background noise makes it hard to hear a possible utterance. 
##  Tier 3: UnusableTrial - fill this in with a 1 if something makes the trial unusable... 
##	...e.g. the experimenter and subject are talking to each other rather than subject doing the task
##  Tier 4: DifficultToScore -  fill this in with 1 if the StopResponse is ambiguous (e.g. you can almost hear a response initiation)... 
##	...note in Comments why it's difficult to score

##  To run this script, you will need to have all sound files (one per trial) in a single directory. 
##
##  Script currently works only for .wav files but code can be edited to instead flexibly accept any file extension, as specified in the "file_extension" variable
##  Edit the names or number of Tiers in the "sentence Tier(s)" line below, or in the GUI that opens when you run the script. 
##  To start at a file other than the first one listed in the directory, use the Starting_file_index field
